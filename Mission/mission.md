# Missions of The Mathbook

## Problems we try to solve 
1. When there is a math or science problem and you want to look up the answer for it. Or when there is a tangent of knowledge where you want to go off and explore more. Normally, the first place to go is wikipedia. However, often for complicated math concepts or jargons, it is extremely difficult to actually follow the wikipedia article and learn anything. Sometimes the wikipedia article is not even correct or has important part missing. You might then go to find some YouTube explanation, but they are either too isolated, when someone just explain one problem and does bad assumptions of what you know and don't know, or too integrated into a series, which assumes that you are watching or reading the whole series of videos or a book in sequence. 

Don't you want to just look up something you want to learn and there is textbook-graded content and well animated concept right ther? Don't you want to just click to something you don't know and see how the concept is related to what you are reading? 

Solution: That is the Mathbook! We provide expert verified content written by well experienced professionals, the convenience of "just look up something and learn" while avoiding confusing wikipedia pages and poorly situated videos/articles.
