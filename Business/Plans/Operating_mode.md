The creator who formats the content to the ready-to-publish format shall be conpensated for 50-60% of the revenue made by the content. Ready-to-publish means that the content is well integrated into the existing Mathbook, with nodes to other existing node established and animation/other educational tools developed. 

The raw content anywhere from just a pdf document, to latex code, submitted to us will need further refurbish. They will be compensated anywhere from 20-30%. 

The content creator shall only be compensated for the content they created themselves. This does not include to the nodes the content is linked to. 


The board reserves the right to accept or deny the content submitted by the creator.
